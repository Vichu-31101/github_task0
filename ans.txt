Egg.
=======
From the theory of evolution we can obviously tell that the egg came first. At some point, some almost-chicken creature produced an egg containing a bird whose genetic makeup, due to some small mutation, was fully chicken. If we wanna look at in a rudimentary way we can assume through the years a T-rex copulated with a donkey to produce the first chiken egg. Hence the egg came first.
